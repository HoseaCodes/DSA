# Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree. A BST has the following property:

For each node, all values in its left subtree are less than the value in the node, and all values in its right subtree are greater than the value in the node.

With a binary search tree, operations like searching, adding, and removing can be done in O(logn) time on average, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, using something called binary search.

This process has an average time complexity of O(logn). In the worst case scenario, let's say with a tree that had no right children and was just a straight line (basically a linked list), the time complexity would be O(n).
