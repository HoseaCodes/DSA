Each Section needs:
- Brief overview anyone can understand
- Coding visualizer or a picture of it
- Why use 
- Pros and Cons
- Time & Space Complexity - using a chart 
  - Headers: Operation - Big O - Explanantion
- What is this data structure / algorithm optimized for with code implementation

Flash Cards

Practice:
- Leetcode
- AlgoExpert
- Steps
  - Solve the problem conceptually
  - Apply this into code
  - If you do not get it in 30 mins look at the solution
  - Understand the solution
  - What is the pattern
