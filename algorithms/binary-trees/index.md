# Binary Trees

All nodes have a maximum of two children. These children are referred to as the left child and the right child. Note that there isn't really a difference between a child being on the left or the right, it's just the convention used to refer to the children and convenient for graphical representations.

To summarize, a binary tree is a collection of nodes. Every node has between 0 to 2 children, and every node except the root has exactly one parent.

```js
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}
```

In binary tree problems, you will be given a reference to the root of a binary tree as the input. You can access the root's left subtree with root.left and the root's right subtree with root.right. Like with linked lists, each node will also carry a value val as data. In a linked list, the tail (last node) has its next pointer as null. In a binary tree, if a node does not have a left child, then node.left will be null, and vice-versa with the right child. Remember that if both children are null, then the node is a leaf.
