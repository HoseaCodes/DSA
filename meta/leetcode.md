| Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | ✅ Completed | Arrays & Strings  | Sliding Window  | <p style="text-align: justify;">To solve this problem, we can use the hash table and iterate over our term. Let's do two checks on 0 and 1 so as not to waste extra time. Now we can start, we gradually add our letters to the hash table, if it already contains this letter, we delete the letter corresponding to the leftmost index. After that we add our new element. The maximum length is found by comparing our current length with the new one, using Math.max.</p> |
| String to Integer (atoi) |  ✅ Completed |  Arrays & Strings    |   n/a | <p style="text-align: justify;">Turn the string into an array. Create a negative and positive max and return the value if the converted string gets out of bounds. If the converted string is not a number return 0 else return the converted number.</p> |
| Roman to Integer |  ✅ Completed | Arrays & Strings |  forLoop, check i vs i + 1 | <p style="text-align: justify;">We need to create a hash table, the characters in which will correspond to a certain number. Passing along the line, we will check the current and the next character at once, if the current one is greater than the next one, then everything is fine, we add it to the result (it is initially equal to 0), otherwise, we subtract the current value from the next value (for example, the current 10, and the next 100 , we do 100 - 10, and we get 90), we also add to the result and additionally increase the index by 1. As a result, at the end of the loop, we will get the result we need.</p> |
| 3Sum |  ✅ Completed | Arrays & Strings | Two Pointer | <p style="text-align: justify;">First, sort the input array in non-decreasing order. Iterate through the array with a pointer "i" from 0 to n-2, where n is the size of the array. For each "i", initialize two pointers "lo" and "hi", where "lo" starts at i+1 and "hi" starts at n-1. Calculate the sum of elements at i, lo, and hi. If the sum is equal to zero, add the triplet to the result. If the sum is less than zero, increment "lo" to move towards higher values. If the sum is greater than zero, decrement "hi" to move towards lower values.
To avoid duplicates, if a value has already been considered, skip it in the future iterations. Continue the above process until all possible triplets are considered.</p> |
