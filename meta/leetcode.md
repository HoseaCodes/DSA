| [Longest Substring Without Repeating Charactersk](./questions/longestSubstringWORepeating.js) | ✅ Completed | Arrays & Strings  | Sliding Window  | <p style="text-align: justify;">To solve this problem, we can use the hash table and iterate over our term. Let's do two checks on 0 and 1 so as not to waste extra time. Now we can start, we gradually add our letters to the hash table, if it already contains this letter, we delete the letter corresponding to the leftmost index. After that we add our new element. The maximum length is found by comparing our current length with the new one, using Math.max.</p> |
| [String to Integer (atoi)](./questions/stringToInteger.js) |  ✅ Completed |  Arrays & Strings    |   n/a | <p style="text-align: justify;">Turn the string into an array. Create a negative and positive max and return the value if the converted string gets out of bounds. If the converted string is not a number return 0 else return the converted number.</p> |
| [Roman to Integer](./questions/stringToInteger.js) |  ✅ Completed | Arrays & Strings |  forLoop, check i vs i + 1 | <p style="text-align: justify;">We need to create a hash table, the characters in which will correspond to a certain number. Passing along the line, we will check the current and the next character at once, if the current one is greater than the next one, then everything is fine, we add it to the result (it is initially equal to 0), otherwise, we subtract the current value from the next value (for example, the current 10, and the next 100 , we do 100 - 10, and we get 90), we also add to the result and additionally increase the index by 1. As a result, at the end of the loop, we will get the result we need.</p> |
| [3Sum](./questions/3sum.js) |  ✅ Completed | Arrays & Strings | Two Pointer | <p style="text-align: justify;">First, sort the input array in non-decreasing order. Iterate through the array with a pointer "i" from 0 to n-2, where n is the size of the array. For each "i", initialize two pointers "lo" and "hi", where "lo" starts at i+1 and "hi" starts at n-1. Calculate the sum of elements at i, lo, and hi. If the sum is equal to zero, add the triplet to the result. If the sum is less than zero, increment "lo" to move towards higher values. If the sum is greater than zero, decrement "hi" to move towards lower values. To avoid duplicates, if a value has already been considered, skip it in the future iterations. Continue the above process until all possible triplets are considered.</p> |
| [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](./questions/removeDuplicates.js) |  ✅ Completed | Arrays & Strings | Two Pointer | <p style="text-align: justify;">Create an insertIndex(first pointer) then iterate over the sorted number array starting at index 1. If the current index value is not equal to the pervious index value then assign the insertIndex index (nums[insertIndex]) to the current index value and increment the insertIndex value by 1. Essentinally, we hold the index of value that needs to be replaced and when we run into the first value that has not been seen we replace the index of value that needs to be replaced and increase that index. Continue this through the remainder of the array and return the insertIndex.</p>  |
| [Next Permutation](./questions/nextPermutation.js) |  ✅ Completed | Arrays & Strings | reverse forLoop | <p style="text-align: justify;">We loop through the numbers provided from end to start, looking for the first occurrence of a number decreasing, which will be our “left swap”. Next, we again look from right-to-left, until we find a number higher than our left swap, and swap the two numbers round. This effectively gives us the lowest possible “swap” that can be achieved for the given array. <br/> <br/> To give a practical example, given the array ```[7, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 0]``` , we can see that the first decrease when looking right-to-left is from 5 to 1, making 1 our left swap. Going right-to-left again, we can then see that the first number higher than our left swap is 2, so we swap them around to give us ```[7, 2, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3, 1, 0]```. <br/> <br/> Next, we sort the numbers to the right of the left-most swapped number to create the lowest possible permutation of the remaining digits. So in the example above, we take the numbers from the right of the moved-over 2, which are ```[5, 4, 3, 1, 0]```, and swap it for its lowest permutation (which we can achieve simply by ordering that array of numbers); ```[0, 1, 3, 4, 5]```. By replacing the original values, this gives us the next greatest permutation of the original number: ```[7, 2, 3, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5]```. <br/> <br/> As another example, let’s take ```[3, 8, 3, 7, 5, 1]```. So, going right-to-left, the first decrease comes at number 3 (index 2), and the first higher number than this, again going right-to-left, is 5, so we swap those around to give us ```[3, 8, 5, 7, 3, 1]```. We then order the numbers on the right of the swapped-over 5 and end up with ```[3, 8, 5, 1, 3, 7]```, which is indeed the next lowest permutation. <br/> <br/> In some cases, there may not actually be the next lowest permutation (for example in the array ```[3, 2, 1]```). In these cases, in line with the question spec, we simply return the lowest permutation, which is easily obtained by ordering the entire array, which gives us ```[1, 2, 3]```.</p> |

| Add Two Numbers  |  ✅ Completed | Linked Lists | Elementary Math | <p style="text-align: justify;">Initialize current node to dummy head of the returning list. Initialize carry to 0. Loop through lists l1 and l2 until you reach both ends and carry is 0. Set x to node l1's value. If l1 has reached the end of l1, set to 0. Set y to node l2's value. If l2 has reached the end of l2, set to 0. Set sum = x + y + carry. Update carry = sum / 10. Create a new node with the digit value of (summod10) and set it to current node's next, then advance current node to next. Advance both l1 and l2. Return dummy head's next node.</p> |
| Merge Two Sorted Lists  |  ✅ Completed | Linked Lists | Intuition | <p style="text-align: justify;">First, we set up a false "prehead" node that allows us to easily return the head of the merged list later. We also maintain a prev pointer, which points to the current node for which we are considering adjusting its next pointer. Then, we do the following until at least one of l1 and l2 points to null: if the value at l1 is less than or equal to the value at l2, then we connect l1 to the previous node and increment l1. Otherwise, we do the same, but for l2. Then, regardless of which list we connected, we increment prev to keep it one step behind one of our list heads. <br/><br/>
After the loop terminates, at most one of l1 and l2 is non-null. Therefore (because the input lists were in sorted order), if either list is non-null, it contains only elements greater than all of the previously-merged elements. This means that we can simply connect the non-null list to the merged list and return it.</p> |
